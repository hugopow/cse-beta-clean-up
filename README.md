CSE 4.0 will GA this quarter. For those partners that have been testing the beta, you’ll need to remove all traces of it before you can install the GA version. VMware does not support upgrading or migrating from beta builds to GA builds.

If you don’t clean up, when you try to configure CSE again with the CSE Management wizard, you’ll see the message below:

“Server configuration entity already exists.”
